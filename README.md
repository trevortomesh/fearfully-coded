**Fearfully Coded** is an open invitation for Christian programmers to dedicate their work to the Lord.

Technology is one of the most powerful — and dangerous — forces shaping our age. From artificial intelligence to pornography, its misuse threatens minds and souls. This project is a small way to respond with prayer, intention, and humility. We believe code can be written in the presence of the Holy Spirit.

## ✝️ Mission

To encourage Christian developers to submit their code to God, create in reverence, and remember that all logic, language, and structure ultimately point back to His design.

**Fearfully Coded** is an open invitation for Christian programmers to dedicate their work to the Lord.

Technology is one of the most powerful ‚Äî and dangerous ‚Äî forces shaping our age. From artificial intelligence to pornography, its misuse threatens minds and souls. This project is a small way to respond with prayer, intention, and humility. We believe code can be written in the presence of the Holy Spirit.

## ‚úùÔ∏è Mission

To encourage Christian developers to submit their code to God, create in reverence, and remember that all logic, language, and structure ultimately point back to His design.

## üôè Prayer for Coders

> In Jesus' name, Amen.

## üôè Project Dedication

This project is dedicated to the Lord Jesus Christ.

May every line of code, every design decision, and every contribution serve not just utility, but truth.  
May this work be a small part of restoring order, creating beauty, and bringing light where there is darkness.

> ‚ÄúWhatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî Colossians 3:23

If you feel called, you're encouraged to copy this dedication into your own project README. Let your work be a testimony.  
You're also warmly invited to use the badge, the coder's prayer, and any part of this initiative in your own work‚Äîfreely and faithfully.



**Soli Deo Gloria.**

## üìö Resources for Christian Programmers

Whether you're seeking spiritual support, community, or theological depth, here are some resources to guide and inspire your coding journey.

We even have a heavenly role model for this work:

### üë¶ Blessed Carlo Acutis: Patron of Programmers

Blessed Carlo Acutis (1991‚Äì2006) was a teenage programmer who used his talents to spread devotion to the Eucharist. Before his death from leukemia at age 15, he built a website cataloguing Eucharistic miracles around the world‚Äîa project now maintained and exhibited globally.

He is widely recognized as a model for young people and digital missionaries. Carlo saw the internet as a way to evangelize and share beauty. His motto was:

> ‚ÄúThe Eucharist is my highway to Heaven.‚Äù

Carlo reminds us that holiness is compatible with coding‚Äîand that even small acts of creation can glorify God.

## üåÄWhat is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe coding** is a modern, AI-assisted approach to development where you guide the generation of code through natural language, intuition, and iterative feedback. Rather than typing every line manually, the developer provides goals and intentions‚Äîand lets the AI do the heavy lifting.
This README was vibe-coded. You can use the badge above to show you‚Äôre riding the vibe, too.
